# WARNING

Some badges fail when plugged in to USB,
the MCU develops a short and destroys itself!
I tried to weed out these faulty MCUs but I can't be sure the ones that
seemed fine won't develop this problem.

## Getting Started

Instructions for building firmware and flashing your badge is in
[laser-tag software/README](laser-tag software/README).
